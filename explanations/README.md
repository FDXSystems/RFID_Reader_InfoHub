# Explanations

## Introduction

Here, we provide theoretical explanations that are necessary or provide more details
and tips on how to use our Readers. 

Tipically, RFID Readers act as a low level interface
through which clients use to interact with RFID tags, having to employ
tons of development time to have a working application, since there's a
lot of binary data handling and RFID internals that have to be dealt 
with. Our approach intents to provide a high-level interface to clients,
through which they can interact with the reader, the RFID module and RFID
tags. Since it's not a common design approach, we think it's necessary to
provide more detailed data on its workabouts
